# Example demonstrating environment variable placeholder expansion in commands
#
# This example shows how to use $VARIABLE_NAME or ${VARIABLE_NAME} placeholders
# in command definitions, which are automatically replaced with environment variable
# values when the agent is loaded.
#
# Usage:
#   export USER=alice
#   export PROJECT_NAME=myproject
#   export ENVIRONMENT=production
#
#   cagent run env_placeholders.yaml -c greet
#   cagent run env_placeholders.yaml -c analyze
