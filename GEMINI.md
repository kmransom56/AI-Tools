# GEMINI.md - Project Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive toolkit for setting up and managing a local AI-powered development environment on the Windows operating system. It uses PowerShell for automation and Docker to containerize and run key services.

The primary goal of the toolkit is to install, configure, and launch a suite of AI development tools, including:
- **IDEs and Editors:** Void, Cursor IDE, and VS Code with extensions like Continue.dev and GitHub Copilot.
- **AI Assistants:** A self-hosted TabbyML instance running in Docker.
- **CLI Tools:** A collection of AI command-line interfaces such as `opencode-cli`, `shell-gpt`, `chatgpt-shell-cli`, and `gpt-cli`.

A notable feature of this project is its integrated system for managing security and identity. It includes scripts and configurations for generating and signing SSL certificates and for code-signing the project's own automation scripts. This suggests the toolkit is designed for a development environment where security and code integrity are important.

The project relies on several external API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) which must be configured as environment variables to function correctly.

## Building and Running

The project is primarily controlled through PowerShell scripts and batch files.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 with Administrator access.
- PowerShell
- Docker Desktop
- The following environment variables must be set:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Installation

The main installation script downloads and configures all the necessary tools and dependencies.

```powershell
# Allow local PowerShell scripts to run
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Run the installer
.\Install-AI-Tools.ps1
```

### Automated Installation and Launch

An all-in-one script is available to both install and immediately launch all the configured tools.

```powershell
.\AI-Toolkit-Auto.ps1
```

### Launching the Tools

If the tools are already installed, you can launch them using the provided batch files.

```batch
# Launch the primary GUI-based tools (Void, VS Code, Cursor)
.\Launch-AI-Tools.bat

# A more advanced launch script is also available, which is called by the installer
.\Advanced Launch-AI-Tools.bat
```

### Managing Docker Services

The TabbyML service and CLI tool containers are managed by Docker Compose.

```bash
# Start the services in the background
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the services
docker-compose down
```

## Development Conventions

- **Automation:** The project heavily relies on PowerShell for automation scripts. These scripts are well-structured, include logging, and are digitally signed for security.
- **Configuration:** Configuration for CLI tools is managed in YAML files within the `/config` directory. The `docker-compose.yml` file is dynamically generated by the installation script.
- **Security:**
  - **API Keys:** API keys are not stored in the repository. They are read from environment variables.
  - **Code Signing:** PowerShell scripts are signed, indicating a practice of ensuring script integrity.
  - **Certificate Management:** The presence of an OpenAPI definition for a Certificate Authority, along with various certificate files and a debug script (`debug_ssl.ps1`), points to a convention of using custom SSL certificates for local development services.
- **Environment:** The toolkit is designed exclusively for Windows and leverages Windows-specific features like Chocolatey for package management and PowerShell for scripting.
