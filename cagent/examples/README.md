# cagent examples

This folder contains curated agent examples split into categories:

- Basic: simple tasks like linting, formatting, or small refactors
- Advanced: agents that run tests, update docs, or propose design changes
- Multi-agent: coordinated teams for complex workflows (root + helpers)

Current examples:
- `golang_developer.yaml` — multi-agent example (root + helper) configured for dry-run

Add more examples following the structure in `golang_developer.yaml` and update this README with short notes about each example's intent and recommended run-mode (dry-run by default).
