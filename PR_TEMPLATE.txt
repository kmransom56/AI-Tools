## Summary
- Updated: two GPU branches gpu-k80-test and gpu-rtx3060ti-test from origin/main

## Tests
- Smoke tests added to AI-Tools-ci/tests/test_smoke.py
- Full test suite attempted; full PyTest stack is not installed in this runner; see notes below.

## Hardware notes
- GPU-K80 (Kepler) testing branch: gpu-k80-test
- GPU-RTX3060Ti testing branch: gpu-rtx3060ti-test

## Next steps
- If you want, I can push branches and open a PR with the results and notes.
- Propose a CI workflow to run on both branches (two-branch hardware sanity checks).
